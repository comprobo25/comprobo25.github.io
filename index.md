The Olin College course "A Computational Introduction to Robotics" (CompRobo) serves as a tour through some of the most important ideas at the heart of modern robotics.  The course utilizes a project-based learning pedagogy that allows students to build mastery of key concepts while also allowing for a great deal of student choice and autonomy.  The major focal points of the course are state estimation, localization, computer vision, decision-making, and societal implications of embodied systems.

## Conclusion and Learning More
CompRobo serves as a fun, hands-on introduction to key ideas in robotics algorithms and toolsets.  Despite the fact that the course is successful at Olin, we realize that everyone's institutional context is different.
