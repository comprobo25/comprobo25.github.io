## Purpose of this How-to

This document will help you run the Neato simulator.  Before going through these instructions, make sure that you have already <a-no-proxy href="../How to/setup_your_environment" data-canvas="https://olin.instructure.com/courses/143/modules/items/1303">setup your computing environment</a-no-proxy>.

## What is a Robot Simulator?

Without getting into too much detail, a robot simulator that simulates a robot interacting with some sort of environment.  As such, a simulator will typically provide the following major functionality.

* It will provide a means to specify the physical layout of the robot's environment (e.g., the location of obstacles, the physical properties of various surfaces).
* It will provide a means to specify a robot model (e.g., the robot's sensors, actuators, mass, inertia, etc.).
* It will provide simulated sensor data (i.e., what *would* the robot's sensors have reported if the robot were in a particular environment in a particular location).
* It will provide a means to execute simulated motor commands (i.e., it will let you tell the robot to move).
* It will provide a way to visualize the simulation state (e.g., as a graphical rendering).

One nice thing about ROS is that the usage of a publish and subscribe structure provides a very clean separation between the robot itself and code that you will write to program the robot.  For instance, you can write a motor control node that sends commands to the topic ``cmd_vel``.  This program can work with any real or simulated robot so long as it subscribes to the ``cmd_vel`` topic and executes the appropriate motor command in response to the messages it receives (e.g., the motor command might involve moving a real motor or it might involve moving a simulated robot).

### Differences with RViz

Oftentimes students will be confused as to what the difference is between RViz and a robot simulator.  RViz allows you to visualize a robot's sensor data.  As such, RViz has a graphical interface that can look a lot like the graphical interface of the robot simulator.  In contrast, RViz does not have any means to execute a simulated motor command or generate simulated sensor data: it can only display the data that it receives.

## The Neato Simulator

<p align="center">
<img alt="screenshot of a Neato in an empty simulated environment" src="../website_graphics/neato_gazebo.png"/>
</p>

We will be using the popular Gazebo software for robot simulation.  Gazebo is a very powerful and customizable simulator that will be especially useful in this online (virtual) version of the course.

## Starting the Simulator

<ol>
<li>Start <tt>roscore</tt>

<p>Got to a terminal and run the following command.</p>

{% highlight console %}
$ roscore
{% endhighlight %}
<p>You should see output that look like the following.</p>

{% highlight console %}

{% endhighlight %}
</li>
<li>Launch Gazebo
<p>You can launch your robot in many different simulated worlds.  For instance, to launch your robot in a simulated obstacle course, <b><i>in a new terminal</i></b>, run the following command.</p>

{% highlight console %}
$ roslaunch neato_gazebo neato_gauntlet_world.launch
{% endhighlight %}

<p>If all went well, you will see a bunch of output stream by and a visualization that looks like the following.</p>

<img alt="screenshot of a Neato in the simulated obstacle course" src="../website_graphics/gauntlet_gazebo.png"/>

<p>Instead if you want to run your Neato around the Olin dining hall, try the following command.</p>

{% highlight console %}
$ roslaunch neato_gazebo neato_dh.launch
{% endhighlight %}

<p>If you want to create your own world, you can put the Neato in an empty world and then follow our instructions for <a href="#populating-the-simulated-world">populating your own world</a>.</p>

{% highlight console %}
$ roslaunch neato_gazebo neato_empty_world.launch
{% endhighlight %}

<p><i>Optional:</i> Loading the camera module. If you want to load a simulated video camera on your Neato, you can modify the instructions in the previous step.</p>

{% highlight console %}
$ roslaunch neato_gazebo neato_dh.launch load_camera:=true
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This will result in a white box appearing over your Neato (the simulated camera).   You can look at the images using, e.g., <tt>rqt_gui</tt></p>

</ol>

## Using the Gazebo Graphical Interface

The Gazebo website has a [guide on using Gazebo's graphical interface](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?cat=guided_b&tut=guided_b2).

## Available Topics

This documentation gives the high-level purpose of each topic.  To explore more, you can use the following command to get more information.

```bash
$ rostopic info topic-name
```

If you want to know more about a message you see in the output of ``rostopic`` you can use the following command (note that the ``-r`` flag can be ommitted if you want to the mesasges nested within the top-level message to be expanded).

```bash
$ rosmsg show msg_package_name/MessageName -r
```

### ``accel``

This is the linear acceleration of the Neato in meters per second squared along each axis of the Neato.  This same information is included in the ``imu`` topic (although there it is nested further).

### ``bump``

This topic contains four binary outputs corresponding to each of the Neato's four bump sensors.  In the simulator, all bump sensors are either on or off (no differentiation is made between the bump sensors).

### ``bumper``

This is an internal topic to Gazebo.  If you are curiouts, you can look at the output as you run into something, but you don't need to worry about it in this class.

### ``clock``

This is the simulator clock.  This is useful for executing commands based on elapsed time.  It is preferable to use this clock rather than the wall clock (your computer's system clock) since the simulation might not run at the same rate as realtime.  You don't typically want to subscribe to this topic directly.  Instead, you can access the time through ``rospy`` (see the [ROS tutorials page](http://wiki.ros.org/rospy/Overview/Time) for details).

### ``cmd_vel``

You publish to this topic to set the robot's velocity.  The ``linear.x`` direction sets forward velocity and ``angular.z`` sets the angular velocity.

### ``encoders``

These tell you the linear travel of each wheel (left is the first element of the array and right is the second) since the simulation started.  You do not have to subscribe to this directly, but instead you can use the ``odom`` topic or the ``tf`` module if you are you are just interested in knowing an estimate of where the robot is relative to where it started.

### ``gazebo/link_states``

This is a Gazebo specific topic (see the [Gazebo docs on ROS communication](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_comm)). 

### ``gazebo/model_states``

This is a Gazebo specific topic (see the [Gazebo docs on ROS communication](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_comm)). 

### ``gazebo/parameter_descriptions``

This is a Gazebo specific topic (see the [Gazebo docs on ROS communication](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_comm)). 

### ``gazebo/parameter_updates``

This is a Gazebo specific topic (see the [Gazebo docs on ROS communication](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_comm)). 

### ``gazebo/set_link_state``

This is a Gazebo specific topic (see the [Gazebo docs on ROS communication](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_comm)). 

### ``gazebo/set_model_state``

This is a Gazebo specific topic (see the [Gazebo docs on ROS communication](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_comm)). 

### ``imu``

This is the simulated IMU (intertial measurement unit).  It has linear acceleration and angular velocity.

### ``joint_states``

These tell you the total rotation (in radians) of each wheel.  Note that this is a "ground truth" value, meaning that it is not estimated from sensors but instead comes from Gazebo.  In a scenario with a real robot, you wouldn't have access to this.

### ``odom``

This tells you the robot's position relative to its starting location as estimated by wheel encoders.  You can get this inforation more flexibly through the ROS tf module, but this is a relatively easy way to get started.

### ``projected_stable_scan``

This provides the LIDAR measusrements (think of these as detected obstsacles or objects from the environment).  In contrast to the ``scan`` topics, these measurements are in the odometry frame (rather than relative to the robot) and are in Caretesian rather than polar coordinates.  There is no need to use this topic, but for some applications it is nice to have.

### ``raw_vel``

you publish to this topic set the left and right wheel velocities independently (rather than setting linear and angular velocities).  You can use this is ``cmd_vel`` for controlling the robot, whichever is easier.

### ``rosout``

This is a topic provided by ROS.  See the [ROS docs on ``rosout``](http://wiki.ros.org/rosout)for more information.

### ``rosout_agg``

This is a topic provided by ROS.  See the [ROS docs on ``rosout``](http://wiki.ros.org/rosout)for more information.

### ``scan``

These are the measurements of the Neato's LIDAR.  This diagram should help you with the project. It shows the angles for the laser range data coming from the Neato and how it maps onto the Neato's physical layout.

<p align="center">
<img alt="A Diagram of the Neato's Lidar" src="../website_graphics/lidar.png"/>
</p>

The LaserScan message consists of a number of attributes:

```bash
$ rosmsg show sensor_msgs/LaserScan
std_msgs/Header header
  uint32 seq
  time stamp
  string frame_id
float32 angle_min
float32 angle_max
float32 angle_increment
float32 time_increment
float32 scan_time
float32 range_min
float32 range_max
float32[] ranges
float32[] intensities
```

Most of these attributes you can ignore for the purposes of this assignment. The one that you will really need to dig into is ranges. The ranges attribute provides 361 numbers where each number corresponds to the distance to the closest obstacle as detected by the laser scan at various angles relative to the robot. Each measurement is spaced exactly 1 degree apart. The first measurement corresponds to 0 degrees in the image of the Neato above. As the degrees in the image go up, so to does the index in the ranges array. Where does 361 come from? The last measurement (index 360) is the same as the first (index 0). Why do we do this craziness?!? We have to do this to adhere to some ROS conventions around LaserScan data that will be important later in the class. For now, you can safely ignore the last measurement (index 360).

### ``stable_scan``

This gives the same data as ``scan`` except the timestamp is automatically adjusted to keep the detected points stable in the odometry frame.  This topic is really only need with the physical Neato robot where the precise timing of the LIDAR is not available due to hardware limitations.

### ``tf``

This is provided by the [ROS tf2 module](http://wiki.ros.org/tf2) to update the relationhsip between various coordinate systems.  Typically you don't subscribe to it directly but instead use the Python tf module.

### ``tf_static``

This is provided by the [ROS tf2 module](http://wiki.ros.org/tf2) to update the relationhsip between various coordinate systems.  Typically you don't subscribe to it directly but instead use the Python tf module.

## Using Rviz with the Simulator

Once the simulator is running, to start rviz, run the following command.

```bash
$ rosrun rviz rviz
```

Once you get to rviz, the warmup project has some good instructionns for how to see the robot and its LIDAR.

1. Set the base_frame to ``odom``
2. Add a visualization of the Neato's stabilized laser scan (topic ``scan``).  This is most easily found by using the "By topic" tab.  Make sure to adjust the size of the markers so you can see them easily).
3. Add a visualization of the Neato itself (this can be done by selecting "Robot Model" from the insert menu")
4. Add a visualization of the Neato's camera feed (topic ``camera/image_raw``) (this only applies if you launched the simulation with ``load_camera:=true``)

## Populating the Simulated World

In order to populate the simulated world, you can use the "insert" menu in Gazebo.  This will bring up a list of 3D models that can be inserted into Gazebo.

<p align="center">
<img alt="the insert menu of the Gazebo simulator" src="../website_graphics/gazebo_insert.png"/>
</p>

Click on one of these models and you should be able to drag it onto the Gazebo world.

### Saving the World

After you've built the world, you can save it using "file -> save world" from within Gazebo.  You should save the world into the directory ``~/catkin_ws/src/comprobo20/neato_gazebo/worlds`` as shown below.

> Note: you must save your world to the directory specified above.  Also, be sure that your world ends with the ``.world`` extension.

<p align="center">
<img alt="saving the Gazebo world" src="../website_graphics/saving_world.png"/>
</p>

### Loading the World

Assuming you performed the steps above to save the world, if you want to reload your world (e.g., you've shutdown Gazebo), you can load your world by running the following command (you should replace "a_whole_new_world" with whatever you named your world when you saved it.  Also note that we omit the file extension ``.world`` in the command below).

```bash
$ roslaunch neato_gazebo neato_world_no_spawn.launch neato_world:=a_whole_new_world
```

## Some Cool Stuff About Simulators

While real robots are undoubtedly cool, there are some really awesome things you can do with as simulator.

### Move Your Robot Around

Using the "move" tool in Gazebo, you can select your robot and move it around (so much easier than getting up and having to move your robot with your hands, right???).  You can also set the location of your robot by using the rosservice ``gazebo/set_model_state`` (e.g., if you want to set the robot's position in code).  More detail on how to use the "move" tool is available on the [Gazebo user guide](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?cat=guided_b&tut=guided_b2).

### Reading the Robot State

Oftentimes you may be trying to get your robot to execute a certain behavior.  With a physical robot, you will usually assess success by observing its behavior visually.  In a simulator, you can actually "cheat" and read the robot's true state right from ROS.  For example, if you were trying to get your robot to drive a square, you could compare the intended square to the actual square by reading the robot's state.  The robot's state is available on the ROS topic ``gazebo/model_states``.

## Shuting Down the Simulator

Go to the terrminal where you executed **step 2** (launch Gazebo) and hit control-c.
